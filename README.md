The objective is to act as an analyst to derive key trends and insights from a provided CPI dataset. The analysis must address the following five questions:

1. Contribution of Broader Categories
Task: Identify the contribution of different broader categories (e.g., Food, Energy, Transportation) to the total CPI basket using the latest month's data.
Constraint: Assume equal weights across all categories for this analysis.
Output: Determine which broader category has the highest contribution (index value-based, totaling 100%).

2. Year-over-Year (Y-o-Y) Inflation Trend (2017 Onwards)
Task: Analyze the Y-o-Y increase in the General CPI (Rural + Urban) inflation starting from 2017.
Output:
Create a graph depicting the Y-o-Y growth rate.
Identify the year with the highest inflation rate.
Provide a reason for the peak inflation year (based on research).

3. Food Inflation Analysis (12 Months Ending May '23)
Context: Analyze data leading up to the November 2023 high inflation, focusing on the 12 months ending May 2023.
Task A (MoM Trend): Investigate trends in the broader food bucket category and evaluate month-on-month (MoM) changes.
Output: Highlight the month with the highest and lowest food inflation.
Task B (Absolute Change & Contributor): Identify the absolute changes in inflation over the 12-month period.
Output: Identify the biggest individual category contributor only within the broader food category towards the inflation change.

4. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Task: Investigate how the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic affected inflation rates.
Focus: Analyze the impact of the first lockdown (Mar '20) on CPI inflation %, specifically focusing on healthcare, food, and essential services categories.
Output: Compare the inflation trend before and after Mar '20 to see the change in inflation percentage.

5. Influence of Global Oil Price Fluctuations
Task: Investigate the influence of major global economic events, specifically imported crude oil price fluctuations, on India's inflation.
Focus: Analyze the Month-on-Month trends for years 2021 to 2023.
Output:
Identify trends in oil price change versus the inflation prices of all categories.
Identify the category whose inflation prices strongly changes with fluctuations in imported oil price (Hint: use correlation analysis, e.g., =correl function).
